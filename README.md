# React Timer
This repo is my attempt at building a Clock app in React, Redux and Material UI. This is a work in progress.

The project is open sourced so others may dig through the code to see working code examples.

## Demo
http://www.andrei.md/react-clock

Demo is powered by github pages. As there's no active server backend, routing is broken when you try to copy/paste deep-linked app urls. For demo purposes, always start at the top route and only use app navigation.

# Working with the project
`npm install && npm start`

# TODO
I used [davezuko's react-redux-starter-kit](https://gitter.im/davezuko/react-redux-starter-kit) to get up and running with this project
